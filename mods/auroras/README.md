Auroras mod for Minetest. Adds northern/southern lights at night.
Since the Minetest world doesn't exactly have polar regions, auroras will appear in any sufficiently cold place.
Be patientâ€”auroras aren't always visible!

### Features:

- Different auroras every night, with semi-realistic colors.
- Players near each other see similar colors.
- Configurable, no media/assets.

This mod works with Minetest 5.2.0 or later, and is compatible with TestificateMods' Climate API/Regional Weather mods.
It probably won't work with other mods/games that regularly change the skybox.
